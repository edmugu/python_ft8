# python_ft8
In the last 2 years, most HAM radio clubs have been recently experimenting with the new [weak-signal communications published Joe Taylor and Steve Franke](https://github.com/edmugu/python_ft8/blob/main/Documents/FT4_FT8_QEX.pdf). I was wondering if I could build the a simple [FT8 transmitter like the one described on hackday.](https://hackaday.com/2021/09/25/the-simplest-ft8-transceiver-youll-ever-build/)
